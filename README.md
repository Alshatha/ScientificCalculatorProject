🧮 Scientific Calculator – Java Console Application
This project is a command-line based Scientific Calculator developed in Java. It allows users to perform a wide range of basic and advanced mathematical operations interactively via menu selection.

✨ Features
The calculator supports the following operations:

🔢 Basic Arithmetic:
- Addition
- Subtraction
- Multiplication
- Division
- Power Function
- Square Root

📐 Trigonometric Functions (in Degrees):
- Sine
- Cosine
- Tangent

📊 Logarithmic & Rounding:
- Natural Logarithm (ln)
- Base 10 Logarithm (log₁₀)
- Absolute Value
- Round
- Ceiling
- Floor

🔍 Comparison:
- Minimum and Maximum

🛠️ Technical Details
-Uses Scanner for console input.
-Includes input validation using try-catch blocks to handle invalid user inputs.
-Implements function pointers (via interfaces) using BinaryOperation and UnaryOperation functional interfaces for clean and reusable code.
-Each operation is modularized into its own method (e.g., performAddition, performSine).
-Displays a dynamic menu and loops until the user chooses to exit.
