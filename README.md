Ceiling

Floor

🔍 Comparison:
Minimum and Maximum

🛠️ Technical Details
Uses Scanner for console input.

Includes input validation using try-catch blocks to handle invalid user inputs.

Implements function pointers (via interfaces) using BinaryOperation and UnaryOperation functional interfaces for clean and reusable code.

Each operation is modularized into its own method (e.g., performAddition, performSine).

Displays a dynamic menu and loops until the user chooses to exit.
